# legacyLook
[Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) extension that aims to bring back the legacy layout from around 2017, while focusing on useablility.
 * Panels have no rounded corners,
 * Gaps between panels are gone,
 * Legacy color palette,
 * Better, resizable cover art display (NOTE: there is currently no hard limit on cover resizing, so you can have it take up half of your screen.),
 * A UI refresh button next to navigation buttons,
 * "Liked songs" link under "Marketplace" on sidebar,
 * Removed cover thumbnails in playlist, so they feel less cluttered,
 * Spotify Connect bar is no longer rounded,
 * Navigation buttons, friends and "My profile" buttons are now rounded rectangles,
 * Minor layout tweaks for bits that annoyed me

  Note: Extension modifies colors with JS, not CSS, so it may not play well with other themes
